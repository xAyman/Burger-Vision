## Introduction
It's a python application which allows you to scan webcam sources. <br>
This tool detects the current person and says if they are smiiling, crying etc...
But the current problem is that the tool is not released right now.
Don't worry, we will do a beta release soon !

## How to use it
Burger Vision is a python library that you can use by typing this code.
```
import burger_vision
webcam = setWebcamObject()
x = webcam.scanExpressions()
print(x)
```
But keep in mind that this code is only an example and burger vision is more powerful than shown here !

## Credits
This tool is coded by me (Ayman) !
But you can update it if you want to.
